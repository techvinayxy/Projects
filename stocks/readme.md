   How It Works
Stock Chart:

The stock data is fetched from an API and displayed on a chart, allowing you to visualize stock price movements over different time periods.
A user can interact with the chart by selecting a time range (1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 5 years).
Stock List:

A list of stocks is displayed on the sidebar with key information such as book value and profit percentage.
Clicking on a stock name will update the chart with the corresponding stock's data.
Security:

The right-click functionality is disabled to prevent unauthorized users from copying or inspecting the source code.
